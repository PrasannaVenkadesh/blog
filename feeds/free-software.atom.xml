&lt;p&gt;We come across a lot of new people throughout our life. There is a reason we call them strangers. Not everyone wins our trust and vice-versa. We don't reveal much about ourselves to those strangers. We try to be more cautious about what information we reveal to them. This is what we call our &lt;strong&gt;Privacy&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Privacy is the ability of an individual or group to seclude themselves, or information about themselves, and thereby express themselves selectively. - &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy"&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whenever we talk about privacy, many people tend to think it in terms of &lt;em&gt;secrecy&lt;/em&gt;. While secrecy is more about the information whereas privacy is more about the ability of one's control over that information. Though they both are different, they both go hand in hand with each other most of the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There goes a song in Tamil cinema which is quite popular,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's take a selfie pulla...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this selfie cultured digital world around us, the need to take privacy seriously arises naturally. Usage of smartphones, laptops and DSR/DSLR camera have become quite common these days. We also know that all these devices are controlled by the software that are already inside those devices. It can be the firmware (or) the operating system (or) the application itself. One such module of these software is called &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exif"&gt;EXIF&lt;/a&gt; which stands for &lt;strong&gt;EX&lt;/strong&gt;changeable &lt;strong&gt;I&lt;/strong&gt;mage file &lt;strong&gt;F&lt;/strong&gt;ormat. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The EXIF defines a lot of properties like the size of the image, dimension, name and model of the device used, date and time of the picture taken, location where this picture was taken (if GPS is enabled and the application has the ability to get location from GPS), whether flash was fired or not when the picture was taken, etc., believe me, there are &lt;a href="http://exiv2.org/tags.html"&gt;a lot of such data&lt;/a&gt; that can be embeded along with that awesome selfie / photograph that we shoot everyday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We think, we are just taking pictures, but most of us aren't aware of the fact that all these so called &lt;em&gt;smart devices&lt;/em&gt; also collect and embed a lot of other sensitive information with our pictures. You don't have to even believe what I am saying. You can try it yourself with this page that I built for demonstrating the same &lt;a href="https://prashere.gitlab.io/exifdata/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the above demonstration, the more &lt;em&gt;undefined&lt;/em&gt; you see, the more happy you can be, because those informations are not present with your pictures. Here is one example that I tried myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="image of a fan" src="https://fsftn.org/blog/content/images/2016/12/20161228_162446.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What information can you extract from the above image? Yes, you are right. It's a ceiling fan and the fan is functioning. What else can you know?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="screenshot of fan with exif metadata" src="https://fsftn.org/blog/content/images/2016/12/with_geolocation.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh crap! This photograph seems to reveal a lot than what we thought! The location of where this picture was taken, the deivce used, date and time, whether flash used or not is also visible. Using these information we can also know that the person who shoot this photograph was using this particular device and this fan and the person was at that particular location on that particular date and time! and yeah the flash did not fire ;) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now what happens when I upload this to social networks (umm, I'll be specific, yeah facbeook)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="screenshot of the same image uploaded to facebook" src="https://fsftn.org/blog/content/images/2016/12/facebook_exif.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Look at this. Facebook retrieves the location and date from these pictures. A lot of such services on the web are waiting for us upload our data and build a profile around us and then sell it to third-party agencies for their profit. Even if we remove (or) edit, there is no way for us to make sure that those informations are actually removed from fb's server. This is how our privacy is compromised at a lot of stage. Remember, our intention was just to share a selfie or photograph that we just took, not any other information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine how much selfies and photograph of our family and friends we shoot and share it in Web! Most liberal minded people would easily say, &lt;em&gt;hey! you are ignorant and it's your mistake that you are not aware of such things&lt;/em&gt;, well I would rather say &lt;em&gt;No. It's not our mistake&lt;/em&gt;, because the software is proprietary in most of the case, we do not even know what the software does in the background and there is no way to know what else the software does when the source code is not available. Moreover, you and I didn't ask for such a feature and also we don't have the freedom to modify the source code under a proprietary regime. That is why we as a movement (Free Software movement) call for the adoption and usagae of &lt;a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html"&gt;Free(dom) Software&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the proprietary software controls the device, it means the creator of the proprietary software is in indirect control of your device. It also means your device is not in your control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, what can we do about this?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;re-configure your smartphone and other smart devices that has camera in it, so that they don't embed these information.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;remove sensitive metadata from your pictures before uploading or sharing it with others.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GNU/Linux users can install a tool named &lt;a href="http://mat.boum.org/"&gt;MAT - Metadata Anonymisation Toolkit&lt;/a&gt; which is also a &lt;em&gt;free software&lt;/em&gt;. This software cleans our image of any such harmful metadata.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I don't find any such free software EXIF removers for Windows (may be because, I don't use windows and so I don't find a need to search for it).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are some EXIF editors and removers for Android at Play Store. (again they are proprietary and I don't recommend them, for they can be harmful too).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are no such EXIF editors / removers for Android in F-droid. (as far as I have searched).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;don't use the &lt;strong&gt;take picture&lt;/strong&gt; option directly from the social network and instant messengers app on your smartphone.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;avoid using proprietary softwares and apps. free yourself by using a free software operating system like GNU/Linux.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am not arguing against EXIF metadata, I am arguing for the case of user's privacy. The application and the ecosystem should be designed in such a way that a user has the control over their digital activity, for it is their data that this ecosystem is making use of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: By the end of January 2017 (26, 27, 28 &amp;amp; 29) the 2nd National Conference and Convention of Free Software Movement of India is set to happen at Chennai, Tamilnadu, India. This conference and convention will be discussion topics ranging from privacy, software freedom, commons, community networks, programming, etc., The confernce is named as &lt;a href="https://4ccon.fsmi.in"&gt;4CCon&lt;/a&gt;. Students, academicians, researchers, software experts, Internet activists, free software hacktivists, social activists are participating. You are also invited. Do visit the site and register yourself if you are interested.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="privacy"></category><category term="code"></category><category term="free software"></category><category term="tech"></category><category term="web"></category></entry><entry><title>Students Practice Free Software. Yet, They Do Not Know</title><link href="https://prasannavenkadesh.github.io/blog/looking-for-free-software-yet.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2015-11-25T00:00:00+05:30</updated><author><name>Prasanna Venkadesh</name></author><id>tag:prasannavenkadesh.github.io,2015-11-25:blog/looking-for-free-software-yet.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I started writing this post soon after I came out of the computer lab completing my lab internal exam. We are given 10 exercise to complete during our semseter lab sessions out of which a random of 2 exercise are given for this internal exam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The title of these 10 exercises are given to us from our seniors and they also shared their code to us through email. Most of these code are downloaded from the Internet &amp;amp; are written in Java.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am someone who hates the verboseness of Java. Anyway I attempted to compile and execute those codes to see what output does the code produce. There were bugs, typos in the code. I debugged &amp;amp; compiled them successfully.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While discussing with my class peers, they said me they were not able to compile successfully for same reasons. Then I shared them the revised code with bugs and typos fixed. They used it to compile and got the lab record completed. I had the same experience during my under-graduate course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless I implemented some of the programs in python for my convinience and also gave the same for those who were looking for much simpler and non-verbose code. Another friend of mine in my class named &lt;code&gt;Dipankar&lt;/code&gt; also tried implementing the algorithms in the languages that he preferred. We both shared our code to our peers and asked them to pick the one they feel better (No, we both were not in a competition. Instead we co-operated with each other).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think, this is nothing short of the Free Software practice except the fact that the code are not licensed and might fall under public domain. The majority of student community today, when given a lab programming exercise to complete, searches for existing code online to reuse and to study the code. They are using it for their own purpose and some even modify the program to fit their requirements. Now this new version of code will be shared with the next batch of students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/"&gt;Free Software says&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the reciever, of the program code, can run the program for any purpose.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the reciever, of the program code, can study the program to know how it works.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the receiver, of the program code, can redistribute the copies of the code to anyone.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the receiver, of the program code, can improve / modify the code and share it with anyone.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The above practice by the student community is in par with what Free Software says. Yet, the student community is unaware of this philosophy and are failing to utilise it to study and improve. They fail to understand that this is the only potential source of knowledge for them. This free flow of knowledge is a gift for them by their predecessors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of rewriting everything from scratch they can reuse them. When they attempt to study the code while reusing them, they can improve them. During this process they might get different ideas that could take their thinking (or) understanding to a new level which might even kindle them, to pursue researches (or) question the current practice of proprietary software development. By this they can set an example for their successors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope the student community will think about it and take this philosophy seriously for the betterment of it's own existence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After having some discussion with my peers who are inspired by Free Software, we decided to setup a git repository of these codes and add Free Software Licenses to them and share it with everyone (I will update the post, when the git repository is ready).&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="free software"></category><category term="education"></category></entry></feed>
