### 1. Do I have a (web)site / blog?

>Yes, I do. You are reading it and also I have some other blogs too.

### 2. Can you access it?

>Answer 1: **Yes**, if you are connected to the global network called Internet.

>Answer 2: **No**, if you are trying to access from Free Basics by Facebook.

### 3. Why is my blog / site not accessible through Free Basics?

>Becuase to make my site / blog accessible through Free Basics, I need to register my site URL to them (Facebook).

### 4. Why did I not add my URL to Facebook? Is it a paid service?

>No, it's not a paid service. Even though it's free to register my URL, I am not going to add there. **Why should I add my site to them, when my URL is already on the Internet? There is only one Internet. Free Basics !== Internet**

>Facebook is trying to take over the control of the global network in their hands and establish their empire in it. This is nothing short of Monopoly.

>The Internet is always Free (Free as in Freedom) and Facebook is trying to put a chain on those free hands.

>To understand the context better, there are two ways of Censoring in Internet:

>1. Blacklisting - list of sites not to allow (blocked sites).
2. Whitelisting - list of allowed sites.

>**Free Basics is a WHITELIST CENSORSHIP** which divides / breaks the Internet into fragments.

### 5. What do we need to do now?

>**Revolt against Freebasics**! If you have a (WEB)site or blog take a Stand. Do not add your Website / Web-blog / Web Application / Web Service to Free Basics List.

### Let us Stand for Internet Freedom.
