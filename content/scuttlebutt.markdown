People are already speaking and writing about what is **Scuttlebot**, **Scuttleverse** and **Patchwork**. If you have not read them or heard them or tried them already, you can explore the following links,

- [An Off-Grid Social Network](https://staltz.com/an-off-grid-social-network.html)
- [An Interview with Secure-Scuttlebutt's Dominic Tarr](https://theinitialcommit.com/2017/04/04/dominic-tarr/)
- [Audio Podcast - Off Grid Social Network with Andre Staltz](https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/2017/05/26/off-grid-social-network-with-andre-staltz/)

My intention in this post is to get you started with all these. Don't worry, it's going to be a cake-walk.

1. Download [Patchwork](https://github.com/ssbc/patchwork/releases/latest) (if you are using GNU/Linux, right click the downloaded `AppImage` file -> properties -> permissions -> `tick` Allow executing file as program) and double click to start.
2. Edit your profile on the first run.
3. Join My Pub - paste the following invite code by clicking on **Join a Pub** in patchwork. `pub.purambokku.me:8008:@hoLKNJ54bWYEFEnkUe2Mo7VdQfMbXCaJ/Pc1zrvHh/M=.ed25519~WdHOY+V+EqF1r1pEynaIYZsnhiMdJK+gZhVWspN5gNo=`

If the invite code doesn't work or expired or invalid, do comment here, I will help you join.
